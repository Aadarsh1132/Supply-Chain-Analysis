# Supply-Chain-Analysis

The supply Chain is the network of production and logistics involved in producing and delivering goods to customers. And Supply Chain Analysis means analyzing various components of a Supply Chain to understand how to improve the effectiveness of the Supply Chain to create more value for customers.

To analyze a company’s supply chain, we need data on the different stages of the supply chain, like data about sourcing, manufacturing, transportation, inventory management, sales and customer demographics.

An ideal dataset for this task which includes data about the supply chain of a Fashion and Beauty startup.!supply_chain_data.csv

## Analyzing the Supply Chain by looking at the relationship between the price of the products and the revenue generated by them:
![newplot](https://github.com/Aadarsh1132/Supply-Chain-Analysis/assets/133105879/8dbbd80e-f4ed-4d42-963b-b1cee59165ec)
Thus, the company derives more revenue from skincare products, and the higher the price of skincare products, the more revenue they generate.
## Let's have a look at the sales by product type:
![newplot (1)](https://github.com/Aadarsh1132/Supply-Chain-Analysis/assets/133105879/b03e373c-d9cd-4644-812a-1aa62adf700e)
So 45% of the business comes from skincare products, 29.5% from haircare, and 25.5% from cosmetics.

##  The total revenue generated from shipping carriers:

So the company is using three carriers for transportation, and Carrier B helps the company in generating more revenue.

## Let’s have a look at the Average lead time and Average Manufacturing Costs for all products of the company:

# Analyzing SKU's
There’s a column in the dataset as SKU's.SKU stands for Stock Keeping Units. They’re like special codes that help companies keep track of all the different things they have for sale. Imagine you have a large toy store with lots of toys. Each toy is different and has its name and price, but when you want to know how many you have left, you need a way to identify them. So you give each toy a unique code, like a secret number only the store knows. This secret number is called SKU.

##  Let’s analyze the revenue generated by each SKU:
![newplot (3)](https://github.com/Aadarsh1132/Supply-Chain-Analysis/assets/133105879/3be83cf4-ac8a-436b-b153-ac3bcc57ba2c)

## Let’s have a look at the stock levels of each SKU:
Stock levels refer to the number of products a store or business has in its inventory.

## Let’s have a look at the order quantity of each SKU:
![newplot (5)](https://github.com/Aadarsh1132/Supply-Chain-Analysis/assets/133105879/853d7b0a-a0a5-4d72-80d2-cd2db36f8415)

# Cost Analysis
## Let’s analyze the shipping cost of Carriers:
![newplot (6)](https://github.com/Aadarsh1132/Supply-Chain-Analysis/assets/133105879/565748cd-7c4f-4e3f-b548-c3e01c311267)
In one of the above visualizations, we discovered that Carrier B helps the company in more revenue. It is also the most costly Carrier among the three.

## The cost distribution by transportation mode:
![newplot (7)](https://github.com/Aadarsh1132/Supply-Chain-Analysis/assets/133105879/6b8dbaf4-0ded-43f2-82fe-671cab00f9a8)
So the company spends more on Road and Rail modes of transportation for the transportation of Goods.

# Analyzing Defect Rate
The defect rate in the supply chain refers to the percentage of products that have something wrong or are found broken after shipping.

## Let’s have a look at the average defect rate of all product types:
![newplot (8)](https://github.com/Aadarsh1132/Supply-Chain-Analysis/assets/133105879/e25dd50e-3422-4421-b53b-6c21b74cdb51)
So the defect rate of haircare products is higher.

## Now let’s have a look at the defect rates by mode of transportation:
![newplot (9)](https://github.com/Aadarsh1132/Supply-Chain-Analysis/assets/133105879/dbd59923-00ad-48e5-a596-3c267ca39ee8)
Road transportation results in a higher defect rate, and Air transportation has the lowest defect rate.

# Summary
Supply Chain Analysis means analyzing various components of a Supply Chain to understand how to improve the effectiveness of the Supply Chain to create more value for customers.
