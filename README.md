# Supply-Chain-Analysis

The supply Chain is the network of production and logistics involved in producing and delivering goods to customers. And Supply Chain Analysis means analyzing various components of a Supply Chain to understand how to improve the effectiveness of the Supply Chain to create more value for customers.

To analyze a company’s supply chain, we need data on the different stages of the supply chain, like data about sourcing, manufacturing, transportation, inventory management, sales and customer demographics.

An ideal dataset for this task which includes data about the supply chain of a Fashion and Beauty startup.!supply_chain_data.csv

## Analyzing the Supply Chain by looking at the relationship between the price of the products and the revenue generated by them:

Thus, the company derives more revenue from skincare products, and the higher the price of skincare products, the more revenue they generate.
## Let's have a look at the sales by product type:

So 45% of the business comes from skincare products, 29.5% from haircare, and 25.5% from cosmetics.

##  The total revenue generated from shipping carriers:

So the company is using three carriers for transportation, and Carrier B helps the company in generating more revenue.
